You are a front-end architect.  
Generate a full responsive HTML5 prototype called "GovernanceMap™ – Competitive Intelligence Platform".

Requirements:
- Use plain HTML, CSS, and minimal inline JS (no frameworks).
- Include sidebar navigation, onboarding screens (3 steps), and final dashboard.
- Dashboard shows:
  - 3 stat cards
  - Interactive governance map (Private–Hybrid–Commons–Protocol)
  - Alerts panel with 3 example alerts
  - Competitor list with governance badges
- Styling: modern, clean, tailwind-like (blue / purple accent)
- Language: English
- Include smooth transitions between onboarding screens.
- Filename: **index.html**

At the end, output the complete HTML file so I can copy it directly into GitHub.
